<h1 align="center">Known issues</h1>

1. Currently window borders do not fade out correctly when switching desktops
2. Picom may not blur immediately and the blur-exclude line may have to be commented out/ reuncommented to get it to work

Please report issues and I will work on them when I can - quick fixes aren't likely however.
