<h1 align="center">Hardware/ What to expect</h1>
<p>I thought I'd include this to try and show why some things might be broken/ slow for others. I have a GTX 960 and use the nonfree drivers on Manjaro - therefore if you experience issues with speed it may be due to picom etc</p>

With the software, do not expect maintenance of these dots in the future and they are subject to change drastically if they do recieve updates resulting in significant changes in theme, functionality, etc. I have only tested this on Manjaro 5.15 Kernel and no other OS - however, I doubt it'd impact much on other OS'.
